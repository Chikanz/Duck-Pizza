Floaty boat is a game made at Global Game Jam 2017, my first ever jam. It's a chilled out, local co-op game where you and a friend use the same controller to control two forest spirits. Create waves by throwing rocks into the river to guide your paper boat, but be careful of debris! Each player can only throw rocks half way across the river, so you'll need to work together if you want to make it!
