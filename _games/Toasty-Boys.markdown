*Toasty Boys* is a series of two games I made in Unreal for Uni. 'Survival' is a simple collectathon, stat management game where you run around as a giant toast man, eating and drinking to stay alive. The other, 'Toasty Boys Grand Prix 2001' takes place in a shrunk down version of the first game. It's a networked platform racing game where you race against another opponent to be the first toast flushed down the toilet. All of the models were sourced from [Poly](https://poly.google.com/), full credits can be found on github. Also the toast can pee.
