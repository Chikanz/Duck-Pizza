*Fruit Head* is a cute and wacky JRPG about finding lost siblings, cults and the power of friendship. It's still in the very early stages development. 

We're making *Fruit Head* for our Uni capstone unit where we'll continue to make the game over 2018. The other weirdos working on this project are [@mishdfied](https://twitter.com/mishdfied), [@Eeveeadict](https://twitter.com/Eeveeadict) and Amy De Jong.
