*Another Reigny Day* gives you the frantic and hilarious duty of defending a castle stronghold from mythical hordes of enemy creatures. The resources of the realm are at your disposal, including siege weapons like cannons,  giant slingshots, elemental staffs, magic towers and others. Talk to tiny cow kings, wipe poo out of your eyes, flip off waves whimsical enemy classes and more in this spicy VR game. 


Coming to Steam... soonish


I helped make this piece as a part of a small team working as an intern for [Mega Cat Studios](https://megacatstudios.com/). I worked on code and design work for the game as well as lots of other small odd jobs.
