*Shooty Shooty fun time* is my first unity game and first time using git. It's a skill based networked shooter drawing inspiration from games like CSGO and Saints Row. Each round a random 'modifier' changes the way the game is played. For example, you might get a gun that only shoots doggos, have low gravity or bullets that shoot huge explosions. You also get a game mode each round, which varies from normal combat to shopping on black friday to trying to score goals with a giant soccer ball.

I made this game for funsies over a few months in 2016 to learn how to use Unity.
