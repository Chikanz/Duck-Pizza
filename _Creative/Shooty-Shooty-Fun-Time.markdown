*Shooty Shooty fun time* is my first unity game and first time using git. It's a skill based networked shooter drawing inspiration from games like CSGO, Saints Row and Rocket League. Each round a random 'modifier' changes the way the game is played. For example, you might get a gun that only shoots doggos, have gravity changed or bullets that shoot huge explosions. You also get a different game mode each round. Game modes vary from regular combat to shopping on black friday to trying to score goals with a giant soccer ball.

I made this game for fun over a few months in 2016 to learn how to use Unity.
