### What?

Short and surreal escape room experience

### Who?

Just me! Made for uni in about a week with sounds from [freesound.org](http://freesound.org)

### Anything to brag about? 

~5,000 plays, really nice comments from players, also somehow found its way to a [random japanese image board](https://bbs.no1game.net/bbs/kareha.cgi/1534811823/) (my proudest achievement)

### Tech?

Unity, Maya, WebGL, Unity Timeline
