Cubi is an alarm clock I made for an electronics subject in high school. It features:

- Glorious 8x8 RGB LED matrix display
- Customizable alarm music that fades in
- Per day alarm
- Customizable clock face
- Modular sliding menu system with animation
- A party mode that cycles between the time, the temperature and a spectrum analyser
- Auto brightness adjustment
- Settings and time keeping that persist through power outages
