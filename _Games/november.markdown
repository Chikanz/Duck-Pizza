### What?

Short and surreal escape room horror game

### Who?

Just me! I made and textured all the models from scratch, created my own interaction system and edited and mixed all the sounds myself from [freesound.org](http://freesound.org)

### Anything to brag about? 

~8,000 plays, really nice comments from players, someone even donated money! It also somehow found its way to a [random japanese image board](https://bbs.no1game.net/bbs/kareha.cgi/1534811823/) (my proudest achievement)

Some lovely lets players also had nice things to say about it:

> "Graphically absolutely beautiful, very atmospheric"

> "At least let me know that I've died, don't leave me in some floating jesus water dimension oh my gosh! Fun game though it was really good"
