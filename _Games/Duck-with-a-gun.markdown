### What?

Duck with a gun is a third person cover shooter where you play as a duck taking down the mob, John Wick style. It's still at a very early stage of development, but you can follow along with the progress on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_I02j_siBz4y7L06nBjjiA/).

### Who?
Just me! And maybe some contractors at some point. Who knows!
