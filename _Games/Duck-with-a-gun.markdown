### What?

Duck with a gun is a third person cover shooter where you play as a duck taking down the mob, John Wick style. It's still at a very early stage of development, but you can follow along with the progress on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/dookdook/).

### Who?
Mostly just me with some additional art by [Alan Robinson](https://twitter.com/arobinsonswork)
