### What?
Dance off against your friends in the game where chess and Smash Brothers collide. Carefully arrange your dancers into special formations to activate your funky dance powers and shove your enemies off the dance floor. *Afro Disco* offers an easy to play, but hard to master casual strategy experience on the go.
