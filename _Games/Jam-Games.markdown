## Floaty Boat
### Global Game Jam 2017
Chilled out, casual co-op game where you and a friend use the same controller to control two forest spirits. Create waves by throwing rocks into the river to guide your paper boat, but be careful of debris! Each player can only throw rocks half way across the river, so you'll need to work together if you want to make it!

*ok like the bulk of these games were made in 48 hours but I definitely polished them up a little after the fact*
