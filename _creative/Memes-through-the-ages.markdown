*You can view this exhibit by clicking the link above. It probably won't work great on mobile*

*Memes through the ages* is an interactive exhibit detailing what life might be like if aliens had given humans the gift of memes 10,000 years ago. It was made for uni assignment where the client was a fake museum that had exhibits on 'alternate history'.

I worked on the layout, styling, animation, text and some of the images with <a href="https://twitter.com/Eeveeadict">@Eeveeadict</a>
